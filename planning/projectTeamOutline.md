    - Define Relationships [X]

- **Functionalities & Routes:**
  - List down the key features and functionalities based on user stories [X]

    - Update: Routes for modifying existing data.
    - Delete: Routes for removing existing data.
  - Plan the Routes to determine the routes/pages for our app. [ ]
  - **API Planning:**
    - Google API [X]

- **Tech Stack Selection**
  - Determine and finalize the tech stack (Frontend, Backend, DB, etc.) [X]
  - Research and select suitable libraries and frameworks [ ]

- **Design Mockups and Wireframing**
  - Create initial design mockups (sketches for basic layout) [X]
  - Develop wireframes for the app layout (more detailed layouts) [X]

## Phase 2: Environment Setup and Development

- **Setting Up Development Environment** (more to input depending phase 1)
  - Set up version control (e.g., GitHub repository). [X]
  - Install necessary tools (Node.js, npm/Yarn, etc). [ ]
